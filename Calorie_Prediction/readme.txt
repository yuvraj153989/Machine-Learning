Greetings,
I have created this Project on my real life experiences and struggles, which I face very often 
while calculating my Calories count.
So, based on data of 15000 users, I have Created a Machine Learning Model which can easily Predict the 
Burnt calories based on Input Data of Height, Weight, Gender, Body Temperature, Heart Rate etc

I have created this using XGBoost Regressor Model, It is an ensemble learning 
method that combines the predictions of multiple weak models to produce a stronger prediction. 
XGBoost stands for “Extreme Gradient Boosting” and it has become one of the most popular and 
widely used machine learning algorithms due to its ability to handle large datasets and its ability to achieve 
state-of-the-art performance in many machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Sklearn
Platform: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, Streamlit
