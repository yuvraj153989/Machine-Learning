Greetings,
I have created this Project just for entertainment purpose, it's a season of world's
largest Domestic Cricket Tournament, Indian Premiere League (IPL).
So, casually I've created a Win/Lose Probability Prediction Website on the basis of 
IPL Dataset from(2008-2021).

I have created this using Logistic Regression Model, along with Sklearn's Pipeline
Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks 
where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class or not.
It is a kind of statistical algorithm, which analyze the relationship between a set of independent variables 
and the dependent binary variables. It is a powerful tool for decision-making. For example email spam or not.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Sklearn
Platform: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, Streamlit
